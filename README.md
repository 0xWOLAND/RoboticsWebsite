# RoboticsWebsite
Me attempting to remake the LASA Robotics Website (link https://lasarobotics.org/) as a freshman at the Liberal Arts and Science Academy. Note that I have the same amount of experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript as a 🍌 banana. But, I shall learn and try to make my first website 🚀.
